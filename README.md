## Commitment

Open CS1 is a commitment that the team at Mimir submitted for the [2018 CSforALL summit](http://summit.csforall.org/static-commitment):

> Mimir, in collaboration with universities around the country, will develop and pilot eight units of free course materials to improve adoption of free digital textbooks and reduce costs for students.

If you use these materials in your course and have feedback to share, please let us know!

**Contact:** oer@mimirhq.com

## Design Principles

These five design principles define the focus of the Open CS1 course materials:

1. Address the most common needs of CS1 courses [A].
2. Empower instructors to remix, refine, and reorder course materials to meet specific needs.
3. Design tasks that are inclusive, accessible, and engaging to students [B].
4. Provide low-stakes formative assessments, not high-stakes summative assessments.
5. Design tasks that allow students to be productive even if they struggle with programming.
 
_A. As defined by [the SCS1](http://home.cc.gatech.edu/csl/31) and limited to courses teaching Python, Java, and C++._

_B. As defined by [the EngageCSEdu engagement practices](https://www.engage-csedu.org/EP-definitions), an OER initiative from the National Center for Women In Technology._

## OER Reference Materials

To help instructors adopt an open textbook, each unit will list relevant readings from the following freely available texts.

## Course Materials

The Open CS1 course materials cover eight units, selected based on a review of CS1 syllabi and the SCS1, a validated, language-independent assessment of CS1 knowledge.

1. Variables, Data Types, Operations
2. Strings
3. Conditional Logic
4. Definite and Indefinite Loops
5. Functions
6. Arrays/Lists
7. Recursion
8. Object-Oriented Basics

Each unit includes the following resources:

- 1 Programming Project
- 6 Review Problems
- 2 Peer Instruction Questions
- Instructor Solution Manual
- Mappings to Recommended Readings

There are three versions of each unit, one in each of the three focus languages: Python, Java, and C++.
