## Unit Overview

This unit includes topics about variables, assignment, data types, and mathematical operations.

In the unit project, students decide how to represent real world information in your programs using data types.

## Learning Objectives

### Practice Problems

- (Understand) Students will interpret errors that arise when using variables incorrectly.
- (Apply) Students will determine that value of a variable after multiple operations.
- (Apply) Students will determine the effect of mathematical operations on different data types.
- (Apply) Determine order of operations for mathematical operations.
- (Apply) Students will compute a quantity using mathematical operations.
- (Analyze) Students will refactor a program to use variables.

### Programming Project

- (Remember) Recall values that belong to simple data types.
- (Remember) Name variables based on the information they represent.
- (Understand) Give examples of real world information that can be represented with a simple data type.
- (Evaluate) Judge recommendations about how to represent information in a program.

## Engagement Practices

Reference the [definitions of the engagement practices](https://www.engage-csedu.org/EP-definitions) from the NCWIT EngageCSEdu project.

### 1. Make it Matter

**1A. Use Meaningful and Relevant Content**

The unit project challenges students to identify representations of data in a real-world technology service: Google Maps' restaurant search. Students also judge recommendations from fictional engineers.

The unit project remixes OER created by Vinesh Kannan, Mary Vo, and Eduardo Vidaurri-Rodriguez for NanoCamp, an online summer camp run by Mimir.

**1B. Make Interdisciplinary Connections to CS**

No notes for this unit yet.

**1C. Address Misconceptions About the Field of CS**

No notes for this unit yet.

**1D. Incorporate Student Choice**

The brainstorm section of the unit project can be modified to allow students to choose their own real-world technology service.

### 2. Build Student Confidence and Professional Identity

**2A. Give Effective Encouragement**
