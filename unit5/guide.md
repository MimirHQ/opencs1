## Unit Overview

The functions unit includes practice problems about function definition, execution, parameters, modularization, and pure functions.

In the unit programming project, which is a special PaintBot challenge, students must use the power of functions to avoid tedious and repetitive code as well as to take advantage of structural similarities in a family of challenges.

## Learning Objectives

### Practice Problems

- (Remember) Students will recognize the different parts of function definition.
- (Understand) Students will interpret the order of function execution.
- (Understand) Students will represent the values of parameters during function execution using stack frames.
- (Apply) Students will write a function that satisfies written requirements.
- (Apply) Students will modularize existing code into a function.
- (Apply) Students will learn to use a function by reading its documentation.
- (Apply) Students will write a function that satisfies written requirements.
- (Apply) Students will convert a stateful function to a pure function.

### Programing Project

- (Apply) Students will use functions to avoid repetitive code.
- (Evaluate) Students will identify patterns in similar structures.

## Engagement Practices

#### 2B. Offer Student-Centered Assessment

Every PaintBot match produces a URL that students can visit to watch a replay of the match. Some students find this replay helpful for debugging their code or noticing opportunities that were not clear from reading the code or imagining the execution. The replay shows all of the bots moves, including rotations, collisions, and painted cells.

You can watch [this sample replay](https://paintbot.glitch.me/?s=3,3,0_0_0_90!1_2_2_270,0_1_0_90!1_2_1_270_0,0_2_0_90_f!1_2_0_0_f,0_2_0_90_f!1_2_0_0_f,0_2_0_90_f!1_2_0_0_f,0_2_0_90_f!1_2_0_0_f,0_1_0_90!1_2_1_0&b=0_0_0!2_2_1!) to see two bots fail to complete their instructions as planned due to collisions.

These replay links can be saved or shared and sometimes make for useful in-class discussions along with the corresponding source code.

**Note:** We are working on improving the accessibility of the PaintBot game and its replays. A current initiative is to add screen reader support to explain the actions taking place in the replay. If you have suggestions or experience that can help us make PaintBot more accessible, please share in the Piazza forum or contact Vinesh Kannan (vinesh@mimirhq.com).

#### 3B. Use Well-Structured Collaborative Learning

Practice problems 4 and 6 are suitable for use as pair programming exercises. Here are some suggested subgoals, which you can provide to students or use as checkpoints for the students to switch roles:

**Problem 4: Charity Raffle Emails**

- Identify the elements of the email template that can be replaced with variables
- Write the function signature for the email template function
- Complete the body of the email template function

**Problem 6: Loyalty Points**

- Write a new function signature for a pure function version of the update function
- Complete the body of the pure update function
- Choose which customer to update loyalty points for based on the input

#### 3C. Encourage Student Interaction
