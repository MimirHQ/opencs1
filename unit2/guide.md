## Unit Overview

This unit covers topics related to getting data in and out of programs.

In the unit project, students stress-test a program that makes important calculations to find out where it can go wrong.

## Engagement Practices

Reference the [definitions of the engagement practices](https://www.engage-csedu.org/EP-definitions) from the NCWIT EngageCSEdu project.

### 1. Make it Matter

**1A. Use Meaningful and Relevant Content**

No notes for this unit yet.

**1B. Make Interdisciplinary Connections to CS**

The unit project challenges students to stress-test a scientific program inspired by how epidemiologists investigate possible foodborne outbreaks.

The unit project remixes OER created by Vinesh Kannan for the Illinois Institute of Technology's Exelon Summer Institute, developed with feedback from Dr. Jialing Xiang, Professor of Biology at the Illinois Institute of Technology and Dr. Andrew Hennenfent, Senior Epidemiologist at the DC Department of Health.

**1C. Address Misconceptions About the Field of CS**

The unit project challenges students to write bug reports for issues they identify. This exposes students to domain content and analytic skills beyond just coding. However, some students may feel that bug reporting is not a glamorous aspect of computing and may need reassurance or instructor perspective on this topic.

**1D. Incorporate Student Choice**
