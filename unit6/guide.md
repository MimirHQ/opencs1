## Unit Overview

This unit includes content about arrays, lists, vectors, multidimensionality, indexing, and related operations.

In the unit project, students implement a cipher program to encode and decode secret messages in images.

## Engagement Practices

Reference the [definitions of the engagement practices](https://www.engage-csedu.org/EP-definitions) from the NCWIT EngageCSEdu project.

### 1. Make it Matter

**1A. Use Meaningful and Relevant Content**

The unit project challenges students to hide secret messages inside images, offering a jumping off point to other computing topics such as image processing or cryptography.

**1B. Make Interdisciplinary Connections to CS**

No notes for this unit yet.

**1C. Address Misconceptions About the Field of CS**

No notes for this unit yet.

**1D. Incorporate Student Choice**

No notes for this unit yet.

### 2. Build Student Confidence and Professional Identity

**2A. Give Effective Encouragement**

No notes for this unit yet.

**2B. Offer Student-Centered Assessment**

No notes for this unit yet.

**2C. Mitigate Stereotype Threat**

No notes for this unit yet.

**2D. Provide Opportunities for Interaction with Faculty**

In the unit project, faculty may develop their own secret encoding/decoding algorithm and release images for the class to try and decode. Faculty may use this as an opportunity to invite students to come to office hours to ask for clarifications or clues while they attempt to crack the code.

### 3. Grow an Inclusive Student Community

**3A. Avoid Stereotypes**

No notes for this unit yet.

**3B. Use Well-Structured Collaborative Learning**

No notes for this unit yet.

**3C. Encourage Student Interaction**

In the unit project, faculty may encourage students to develop their own secret encoding/decoding algorithms and release images for their classmates to try and decode.
