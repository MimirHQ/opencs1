## Unit Overview

The conditional logic unit includes practice problems about boolean expressions, selection, and validation.

In the unit project, students program a fictional self-driving vehicle to make tough ethical decisions.

## Learning Objectives

### Practice Problems

- (Remember) Students will recall how to determine the parity of a number.
- (Apply) Students will complete a truth table for a compound boolean expression.
- (Apply) Students will modify code to use logical operators instead of nested conditionals.
- (Understand) Students will determine which branch of a conditional statement will be executed.
- (Apply) Students will write conditional code that implements written requirements.
- (Apply) Students will transform conditional code to incorporate a new written requirement.
- (Apply) Students will write conditional code that implements written requirements.
- (Apply) Students will validate parameters to a function.

### Programming Project

- (Apply) Students will convert written rulesets into conditional code.
- (Analyze) Students will identify possible unintended ethical consequences of an algorithm.
- (Create) Students will design an algorithm that reflects your values.

### ACM Core Curriculum

Course materials in this unit may be used to relate to the following learning outcomes from the Professional Ethics section of the ACM Computer Science Core Curriculum:

- Identify ethical issues that arise in software development and determine how to address them technically and ethically. [Familiarity]
- Explain the ethical responsibility of ensuring software correctness, reliability and safety. [Familiarity]
- Describe ways in which professionals may contribute to public policy. [Familiarity]
- Identify examples of how regional culture interplays with ethical dilemmas. [Familiarity]
- Evaluate the professional codes of ethics from the ACM, the IEEE Computer Society, and other organizations. [Assessment]
- Describe issues associated with industries' push to focus on time to market versus enforcing quality professional standards. [Familiarity]

## Engagement Practices

Reference the [definitions of the engagement practices](https://www.engage-csedu.org/EP-definitions) from the NCWIT EngageCSEdu project.

### 1. Make it Matter

**1A. Use Meaningful and Relevant Content**

This project remixes and builds on [the Ethical Engine activity](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-ethical-engine-integrating-ethical-design-into-intro-to-computer-science-4f9874e756af), created by Dr. Evan Peck and Gabby LaBorwit at Bucknell University.

The Ethical Engine is like self-driving car-focused twist on the classic trolley problem.

Is this activity meaningful and relevant to your students? Or does it reflect a niche interest?

**1B. Make Interdisciplinary Connections to CS**

No notes for this unit yet.

**1C. Address Misconceptions About the Field of CS**

No notes for this unit yet.

**1D. Incorporate Student Choice**

No notes for this unit yet.

### 2. Build Student Confidence and Professional Identity

**2A. Give Effective Encouragement**

The three practice rulesets for the Ethical Engine activity gradually scale up, though the third ruleset may involve far more code than the first two. The goal is to help students get warmed up before they write their own decision algorithm.

**2B. Offer Student-Centered Assessment**

No notes for this unit yet.

**2C. Mitigate Stereotype Threat**

No notes for this unit yet.

**2D. Provide Opportunities for Interaction with Faculty**

No notes for this unit yet.

### 3. Grow an Inclusive Student Community

**3A. Avoid Stereotypes**

The people in the Moral Machine and Ethical Engine scenarios have a diverse range of attributes. What would your students add?

Do any of your students feel uncomfortable talking about the scenarios or making a decision in their algorithm?

**3B. Use Well-Structured Collaborative Learning**

The following practice problems might make for good pair programming activities during class. Consider some example subgoals:

- Problems 6: Vending Machine
    - Validate keypad
    - Validate payment
    - Validate stock
    - Print appropriate messages
- Programming Project Part 2
    - Create new written rulesets for pair programming, or have students write the rulesets

**3C. Encourage Student Interaction**

Do you have an in-class activity or ice breaker that uses the Ethical Engine? Please share!

The Ethical Engine activity can be extended in many ways! Here are some ideas:

- From Bucknell University: obfuscate the code for students' algorithms, exchange them, then try to detect bias in the black-boxed algorithms.
- Post graphs of the results of students' algorithms on a large set of scenarios, ask students to try to match their classmates' source code to the graphs, or to try to point out their own algorithm's graph/
- Exchange obfuscated student algorithms and challenge students to try and find scenarios where the decision of the algorithm differs from the values expressed in the written description.
